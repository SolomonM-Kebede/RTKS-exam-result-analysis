Its just a simple practice to analyse data from RTKS exam result.
I imported first two important python libraries which are pandas and matplotlib.pyplot. I read CSV file which i have created from pdf file using Tabula.
I cleaned the data and then compared to catagorize in different labels. Finaly i visualize the labels using pie chart.
